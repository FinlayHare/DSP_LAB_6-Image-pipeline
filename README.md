# DSP_LAB_6-Image-pipeline



  The processing pipeline involves loading a grayscale image, removing noise with a median filter, enhancing contrast, detecting edges with the Canny method, and optionally applying a low-pass filter in the frequency domain.

  Each stage relates to DSP operations by handling image data transformation, noise reduction, signal enhancement, and feature extraction through established digital processing techniques.

  Possible improvements include using adaptive filtering for noise reduction and choosing advanced edge detection methods, while limitations exist in processing images with excessive noise or low contrast.
